# 🙌 Don't Worry!

This program is **only a simulation** of a BIOS/UEFI setup utility.  
It is designed for **educational and entertainment purposes** and runs entirely in your terminal.

---

## 🔒 Safety Guarantee

- ✅ **No real BIOS access** — The program does not connect to or modify your computer’s firmware.
- ✅ **No hardware changes** — CPU, memory, storage, and security settings shown are simulated.
- ✅ **Safe configuration file only** — All changes are stored in a local file (`bios_config.json`) inside the project folder.
- ✅ **Cross-platform** — Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux without touching system-level components.

## 📂 What Actually Happens

- When you "Save & Exit," the program writes your settings to `bios_config.json`.
- When you "Discard & Exit," no changes are saved.
- On the next run, the simulator loads settings from that file to recreate your previous session.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is meant to:
- Help users understand what a BIOS interface looks like.
- Provide a safe environment to practice navigating menus.
- Offer a fun retro-style terminal experience.

## 🚀 Reminder

Your **real BIOS/UEFI firmware remains untouched**.  
All activity is contained within this Python program.

So relax — explore, toggle, and experiment freely.  
**Don't worry, nothing on your actual system will change!**
